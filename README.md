Adobe shockwave was discontinued as a PaaS that was popular in the 90's to early 2000's. It allowed for the creative interactive content...Like games and animations for web pages. The Developers soon replaced it during the dot com bubble when HTML5 emerged as a litigious competitor. JavScript simulates the "shockwave" feature by manipulating DOM elements and canvas SVG files. Leveraging involvement in physics that create visual effects. Hence, "shockwave".
